This repository showcases a common, yet subtle, error in C programming involving pointer arithmetic and memory modification. The `bug.c` file contains code that demonstrates the issue, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version. The problem stems from the potential for unintended side effects when modifying variables through pointers. This simple example highlights the need for careful pointer manipulation to avoid unexpected results and maintain code stability.
